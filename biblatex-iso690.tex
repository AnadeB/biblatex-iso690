\section{Introduction}

\subsection{About}

\biblatex is bibliography and citation tool for \LaTeX. This project provides
support for citations and references according to ISO 690 international standard.
As the norm ISO 690 is a little bit ambiguous in some details regarding formatting of records,
we largely follow requirements of Czech interpretation, as it is required form
in many Czech universities. Of course, style can be used in other languages as well.

\subsection{Requirements}

Basically, \biblatex $\geq$ 3.4 with \biber $\geq$ 2.5 is all you need to use this package.
No special packages different from those required by \biblatex package are used. For complete
list of such packages, please refer to the \biblatex documentation.

\subsection{License}

GNU/GPL 3

\subsection{Acknowledgments}

Thanks to all contributors who have participated on the development of this style,
especially Johaness Bötchner, Moewew, Dávid Lupták and others.

\section{Use}

\subsection{General}

\begin{verbatim}
..
\usepackage[english,czech]{babel}
% or in case of using xelatex, use polyglossia package instead
\usepackage{polyglossia}
\setmainlanguage{czech}
\setotherlanguage{english}
..
\usepackage[
   backend=biber
  ,style=iso-authoryear
  ,sortlocale=cs_CZ
  ,autolang=other
  ,bibencoding=UTF8
]{biblatex}
\addbibresource{filename.fileextension}
..
\printbibliography

\end{verbatim}

According to the ISO 690 norm, some of the elements of the bibliographic
resource should be printed in the main document language (language I~am
currently writing) while the others in the language of a resource. You can
specify the language of a resource into the field \t|langid| on the per-entry
basis in a resource (\t|.bib|) file. In addition, all of the languages
specified in these fields have to be loaded by \t|babel| or \t|polyglossia|
package respectively.\label{gen:multilang}

Note that for correct support of localization functionality, \t|babel| package
should be used. The main document language is the last one entered
in a list of languages passed to this package.

\subsection{Package options}

\subsubsection{Provided by \biblatex by default}

Frequently used package options are

\begin{description}
\item[style] style to be used for bibliographic references and citations.
Three possibilities are available, \t|iso-authoryear| commonly known as
Harvard system, \t|iso-numeric| as a numeric system and \t|iso-authortitle|.

\item[backend] backend program for generating bibliographic entries. \biber
is default backend for \biblatex package, providing a big variety
of features. Another options are \t|bibtex| and \t|bibtex8|, but they both
are far behind the possibilities of \biber. \biber is the recommende backend.

\item[autolang] controls which language environment is used. The most
significant value is \t|other|, which supports printing localization
terms in language of resource or language specific hyphenation. Default
value is \t|none|, which disable this feature.

\item[sortlocale] resposible for sorting the bibliography according to the
entered \t|locale| language identifier. The main document language one should
be set.

\item[bibencoding] specifies the encoding of the \t|bib| files. \t|<encoding>|
needs to be explicitely specified only if the encoding of the \t|bib| file
is different from the one of the \t|tex| file. Default value is \t|auto|, i.e.
the encoding of the \t|bib| file is identical to the encoding of the \t|tex|
file.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Provided by \t|biblatex-iso690| in addition}

\begin{description}
  \item[spacecolon] if \t|true|, the space is printed before the colon
  used in subtitles and publication information. Printing the colon this way
  is not recommended. Default value is \t|false|.

  \item[pagetotal] Number of total pages is no longer required if the item
  is being cited as a whole. Setting this option to \t|true| will print
  such optional information in the notes section at the end of the reference.
  Default value is \t|false|.\label{pkg:opt:iso690:pp}

  \item[shortnumeration] The standard ISO 690 allows omission of term
  \t|volume| and terms for smaller components of a serial publication.
  If this option is \t|true|, such terms are distinguish typografically
  (the volume number in bold type and the part number, if required, in
  parentheses). If \t|false|, such terms are printed with preceding
  literal terms.
\end{description}


\subsection{Resource database}

\t|biblatex| supports more entry fields than legacy \t|bibtex|. Hence
some examples of bibliography entries with respective fields follow.

%\begin{description}

\paragraph{Book} \hfill\\

\c{t01}
\begin{verbatim}
@BOOK{t01,
  author      =   {Borgman, Christine L.}, 
  year        =   {2003},
  title       =   {From Gutenberg to the global information infrastructure}, 
  subtitle    =   {access to information in the networked world},
  edition     =   {1},  % should be not stated
  location    =   {Cambridge (Mass)}, 
  publisher   =   {The MIT Press},
  pagetotal   =   {xviii, 324},
  isbn        =   {0-262-52345-0},
  langid      =   {english}
}
\end{verbatim} 

The \t|edition| field is edition of a printed publication. It's required
if the item is not a first edition. Use integer or literal string to fill in
this field.

The \t|pagetotal| field is total number of pages of the work. If multiple
kinds of numeration is used in the work, e.g. arabic as well as roman numerals,
both can be provided, separated by comma. Only for arabic numerals
the localization term \t|pages| is appended. Note that total number of pages
is no longer required, see also \ref{pkg:opt:iso690:pp}.

The \t|langid| field is required for multilingual support of printing
references. This affects printing of localization terms used in the reference,
e.g. \t|edition| field. See also \ref{gen:multilang}.

\paragraph{Contribution to a collection} \hfill\\

\c{t02}
\begin{verbatim}
@INCOLLECTION{t02,
  author        =   {Greenberg, David}, 
  year          =   {1998},
  title         =   {Camel drivers and gatecrashers},
  subtitle      =   {quality control in the digital research library},
  editor        =   {Hawkins, B.L and Battin, P},
  booktitle     =   {The mirage of continuity},
  booksubtitle  =   {reconfiguring academic information 
                      resources for the 21st  century}, 
  location      =   {Washington (D.C.)}, 
  publisher     =   {Council on Library and Information Resources; 
                      Association of American Universities}, 
  pages         =   {105-116},
  langid        =   {english}
}
\end{verbatim} 

The \t|title| field is title of the contribution, the \t|booktitle|
is title of the collection.

The \t|pages| field is one or more page numbers or page ranges. This field
is essential since the reference should identify the part of the item
that is cited.

It's also possible to use the cross-referencing feature to reference
from a contribution entry (child entry) to a separate entry of collection
(parent entry). This can be done by the field \t|crossref|
as the following example shows:
\newline

\noindent\c{prispevek1}
 
\begin{verbatim}
@COLLECTION{sbornik,
  title       =   {Mimořádně užitečný sborník},
  editor      =   {Geniální, Jiří},
  year        =   {2007},
  langid      =   {czech},
  location    =   {Praha},
  publisher   =   {Academia},
  isbn        =   {978-222-626-222-2}
}

@INCOLLECTION{prispevek1,
  crossref    =   {sbornik},
  title       =   {Velmi zajímavý článek},
  author      =   {Vlaštovka, Josef},
  pages       =   {22-45}
}
\end{verbatim}

Now, there is no need to fill in \t|booktitle| in the \t|sbornik| entry.
The \t|biber| backend program performs the inheritance between parent and
child entry automatically.

\paragraph{Article in a serial}\hfill\\

\c{t03}
\begin{verbatim}
@ARTICLE{t03,
  author        =   {LYNCH, C.},
  year          =   {2005},
  title         =   {Where do we go from here?},
  subtitle      =   {the next decade for digital libraries},
  journaltitle  =   {DLib Magazine},
  volume        =   {11},
  number        =   {7/8},
  urldate       =   {2005-08-15},
  url           =   {http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july05/lynch/07lynch.html}, 
  issn          =   {1082-9873},
  langid        =   {english}
}
\end{verbatim}

The example above is an article in online magazine. If the magazine
is available online only, i.e. it is not published in print,
it should be cited as an electronic information resource. This can be
achieved by providing the \t|urldate| field. On the other hand
\newline

\c{knuth}
\begin{verbatim}
@PERIODICAL{tug,
  journaltitle  =   {TUGBoat},
  publisher     =   {TUG},
  issn          =   {1222-3333},
  langid        =   {english},
  date          =   {1980/},
  url           =   {http://tugboat.tug.org/}
}

@ARTICLE{knuth,
  author        =   {Knuth, Donald},
  title         =   {Journeys of \TeX},
  volume        =   {17},
  number        =   {3},
  year          =   {2003},
  pages         =   {12-22},
  url           =   {http://tugboat.tug.org/kkk.pdf},
  crossref      =   {tug}
}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent the example shows an article in printed magazine, which is also
available online. Similar to the contribution to a collection,
cross-referencing feature is possible to be used.
